            <p class="lead">The Hogwarts letter is a letter of acceptance to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, sent to British wizards and witches prior to their first year at Hogwarts. A special quill exists, which writes down the name of every magical child in Britain at the time of their birth. This allows Hogwarts letters to be sent to all magical children at the appropriate time, even those who are Muggle-born.</p>

            <p>However, you must belong to a house before we send you a letter.</p>
